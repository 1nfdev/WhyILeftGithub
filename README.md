# WhyILeftGithub
An explanation as to why I no longer host my repositories on Github.

Github has [entered into an agreement with Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) to be purchased. Under this agreement, "GitHub will be led by CEO Nat Friedman, an open source veteran and founder of Xamarin, who will continue to report to Microsoft Cloud + AI Group Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie".

Here are some of the things the Microsoft Cloud + AI Group are up to:

* [Trying to win the JEDI contract, a 10 billion dollar contract with the Pentagon](https://about.bgov.com/blog/amazon-microsoft-battle-jedi-contract-d-c-metro-ad-war/)
* [Won a 6 year cloud computing agreement with 17 U.S. intelligence agencies](https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2018/05/16/microsoft-ic-pact.aspx)
* [Wrote about their pride that Azure is mission critical to ICE](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuregov/2018/01/24/federal-agencies-continue-to-advance-capabilities-with-azure-government/)
* [Entered the "Predictive Policing" market](https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/articles/industries/citynext/safer-cities/predictive-policing-the-future-of-law-enforcement/), using Chicago as their case study. The Chicago PD is notoriously corrupt. The [Department of Justice investigation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/925846/download) of Chicago's police department found "a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force" and numerous violations of citizens Constitutional rights.

I did not become an open source software developer in order to be used to help increase the market value and image of a company making billions of dollars enabling surveillance, violence, and human rights abuses.

I will keep my github account, as we, the open source software community, have put nearly all of our eggs in this basket and I cannot collaborate and contribute to projects I work on without it. At the very least, I can stop hosting my own projects here.
